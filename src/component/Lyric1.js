    <p>All of these eyes are into you<br/>
    And i like how you are<br/>
    So unaware of it<br/>
    You're just like an abstract palette<br/>
    I don't know why<br/>
    I thought the star is too shy to come out<br/>
    Cause you're full of beauty<br/>
    But i forgot it's jakarta skies<br/>
    So, polutions, you know?<br/>
    But it's okay my knee still hurts anyway<br/>
    Although you're just sittin' there<br/>
    But it feels like you got the power to make me buy you a roses<br/>
    Yet i can't do anything with this empty wallet<br/>
    Can i still get into the fluffy little space in your heart?<br/>
    Must be nice<br/>
    If you become my new queen<br/>
    Even though<br/>
    I know my imagination<br/>
    Will only tattoo<br/>
    A wound in my heart<br/>
    I know you're just sittin' there<br/>
    But it feels like you got the power to make me fall in love oh<br/>
    Can i still get into the fluffy little space in your?
    
    Girl, you look like an aloe vera, i mean <br/>
    I like how your blouse suits your brown eyes<br/>
    You want me to be honest<br/>
    But if i did<br/>
    Won't it be boring?<br/><br/>
    I'm not good at saying my real thought<br/>
    I said you're so pretty i'm thinking of my Grandma's chair<br/>
    If i'm being honest<br/>
    Won't it become weird?<br/><br/>
    I want to tell you the truth<br/>
    But it seems you like it<br/>
    When i say you're so pretty<br/><br/>
    Your laugh<br/>
    It's zero star out of five<br/>
    But i won't tell you<br/>
    My lies, as you can see<br/>
    Makes me nice<br/>
    Pretend i was being honest<br/>
    Won't it makes you mad?<br/><br/>
    I want to tell you the truth<br/>
    But it seems you like it<br/>
    When i say you're so pretty<br/><br/>
    I want to tell you the truth<br/>
    But it seems you like it<br/>
    When i say you're so pretty<br/>
    Baby, if you're happy i'll keep my falsity<br/>
    Salah kayanya tuh<br/>
    Hah
