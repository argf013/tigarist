const lyric1 = `All of these eyes are into you
And i like how you are
So unaware of it
You're just like an abstract palette
I don't know why
I thought the star is too shy to come out
Cause you're full of beauty
But i forgot it's jakarta skies
So, polutions, you know?
But it's okay my knee still hurts anyway`
