                "All of these eyes are into you\nAnd I like how you are\nSo unaware of it\nYou're just like an abstract palette\nI don't know why\n\nI thought the star is too shy to come out\nCause you're full of beauty\nBut I forgot it's Jakarta skies\nSo, pollutions, you know?\nBut it's okay my knee still hurts anyway\n\nAlthough you're just sittin' there\nBut it feels like you got the power to make me buy you roses\nYet I can't do anything with this empty wallet\nCan I still get into the fluffy little space in your heart?\n\nMust be nice\nIf you become my new queen\nEven though\nI know my imagination\nWill only tattoo\nA wound in my heart\n\nI know you're just sittin' there\nBut it feels like you got the power to make me fall in love oh\nCan I still get into the fluffy little space in your?"
